# Machine Learning Course (Andrew Ng, Stanford University)

This repository contains code for the exercises of Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera. As recommended by Andrew, the exercises have been completed in Octave.

The following exercises are completed, all passed with 100 %:

1. House price prediction using linear regression.
2. Quality assurance predictions using logistic regression.
3. Recognition of hand-written digits using multi-class classification.
4. Recognition of hand-written digits using a neural network.
5. Study of models with different bias-variance properties.
6. Spam classification using support vector machines.
7. Image compression using K-means clustering. Low-dimensional representation of face images using principal component analysis.
8. Anomaly detection of failing servers on a network. Recommender system for movies using collaborative filtering.
